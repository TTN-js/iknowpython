# Operators are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands.

# Ex. (operand operator operand) => 4 + 5 =  9 

# Operator Types 

# Arithmetic Operator 
+ # Addition
- # Subtraction
* # Multiplication 
/ # Division 
% # Modulus (returns remainder)
** # Exponent 
// # Floor Division (Division of operands where the result is the quotient with digits after the decimal point are removed. If one of the operands is negative the result is "floored" rounded AWAY from zero)

# Comparison Operators 
== # if two operands are equal 
!= # if two operands are not equal 
> # if calue of left operand is greater than the right
< # if the value of left operand is less than the right
>= # if the calue of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right 
<= # if the value of left operand is less than of equal to the value of the right

# Assignment Operators 
= # Assigns values from right side operands to the left side operand 
+= # Adds right operand and left operand and results to left operand c += a is equivalent to c = c + a
-= # Substracts right operand and left operand 
*= # Multiplies right operand with the left operand 
/= # Divides left operand with the right operand 
%= # Takes modulus using two operands 
**= # Performs exponetial calculation on operators
//= # Performs floor division on operators 

# Bitwise Operators  NEED TO REVIEW THIS 
& # Binary AND
| # Binary OR 
^ # Binary XOR (has to be one or the other)
~ # Binary Ones Complement (no clue ???)
<< # Binary Left Shift
>> # Binary Right Shift 

# Logical Operators
and  # if both operands are true then condition is true 
or # if any to the two operands are non-zero then condition is true
not # used to revers logical state 


# Membership Operators
in # true if it finds a variable in the specified sequence 
not in # true if it does not find a varibale in a specified sequence

# Identity Operators
is # true if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same boject 
is not # false if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object
