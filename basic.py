# BASIC SYNTAX

'''
Python Identifiers - used to identify variables, fucntions, class, module, or object.
- @,$,% : are not allowed within identifiers
- Python IS case sensitive

=============================================
Naming Conventions
Classes - start with an uppercase letter, all other identifiers start with lowercase letters.

Private Identifers are led with a single underscore.
Strongly Private Identifiers are led with double underscores.
Language Defined identifiers end will two trailing underscores.

There are 30 Reserved Words that we will cover later. 

=============================================
Lines and Indentation
No braces to indicate blocks of code.... What!? Indentation is rigidly enforced!
All statments within the code block must be indented the same amount. 

Multiple-Line Statments
Use + \ to denot that the line should continue. 
Statements that contain [],{},or() brackets don't need \ to indicate continuation.

Quotation
Single(''), Double(""), Triple quotes are acceptable to denote string literals. 
Triple quotes are used to span a string across multiple lines.

Comments in Python
# is used to start a comment, don't use triple quotes to create comment blocks unless its temporary, its a nono. 

Blank lines are ignored, unless you are interacting via interpreter session. You must enter an empty physical line to terminate a multiline statement. 

"\n" are used to create new lines just like other languages. 

; are used to allow multiple statments on a single line given that neither statments starts a new code block. 

Suites - Individual statments that make up a single code block.
Header Lines - are used to start a compound or complex statement. Header Lines are terminated with : followed by the suite. 

=============================================
Command Line Arguments 
Use python -h to list python line arguments.
